CampusBite Development Timeline (6-8 Months)

Phase 1: Planning & Setup (Weeks 1-4)
Research and Design:

Finalize the app's architecture, key features, and Spoonacular API capabilities.
Create wireframes and UI/UX design for major screens: onboarding, meal planner, recipe search, social feed, and profile pages.
Initial Setup:

Set up GitHub/GitLab for version control.
Set up cloud environments (Firebase, AWS, or Heroku).
Configure the Spoonacular API and manage necessary API keys.
Phase 2: Core server & Database Setup (Weeks 5-8)
server Foundation:

Develop the core server with Node.js and Express.
Implement user authentication (Firebase Auth or Auth0) to manage accounts.
Database Schema:

Design and set up the database schema in MongoDB or Firebase, covering users, recipes, social interactions, and preferences.
Implement CRUD operations for key entities: recipes, social posts, grocery lists.
Phase 3: Core Features Development (Weeks 9-16)
Recipe Finder & Planner:

Integrate Spoonacular API to retrieve recipes based on filters: budget, diet, prep time.
Add "Leftover Recipes" feature to allow users to find recipes based on available ingredients.
Nutrition & Dietary Tracking:

Use Spoonacular’s nutrition data to create a basic health dashboard.
Enable user preferences (e.g., vegan, low-carb) to personalize recipe recommendations.
Grocery List Generator:

Implement a feature to generate a grocery list from recipes with categorization.
Add cost estimation using Spoonacular’s cost-per-recipe data.
Phase 4: Basic Frontend Development (Weeks 17-24)
Frontend Setup:

Set up the React Native project for cross-platform (iOS and Android) development.
UI for Core Features:

Build UI screens for the recipe finder, grocery list, and health tracking.
Implement navigation between screens using React Navigation.
Set up Redux (or Context API) for state management to store user sessions, preferences, and recipe data.
Integrate server API:

Connect frontend components to the server API for real-time data.
Implement error handling and validation on user inputs for recipes, nutrition, and grocery lists.
Phase 5: Social & Community Features (Weeks 25-28)
Social Feed & Sharing:

Develop the social feed for users to post photos, comments, and recipe tips.
Implement a basic like/comment system and a server for handling interactions.
Challenges & Badges:

Build a challenges feature where users can participate in or create meal-prep challenges.
Set up badges or awards for completed challenges with simple leaderboards.
Phase 6: Advanced Features & Integrations (Weeks 29-36)
Group Meal Planning:

Add functionality for users to invite friends to join shared grocery lists or plan meals together.
Implement sync features for shared lists to allow real-time updates.
On-Demand Cooking Help:

Add a section with embedded video tutorials and quick food hacks.
Implement an “emergency” button for recipe or ingredient substitution tips.
Budget Analyzer & Meal Cost Tracker:

Set up tracking for monthly grocery spending based on Spoonacular’s cost estimates.
Add notification for budget limit warnings and suggestions for cost-friendly recipes.
Phase 7: Testing & Optimization (Weeks 37-40)
Testing:

Conduct unit testing on both server and frontend.
Perform integration testing for key flows: recipe search, grocery list generation, and social interactions.
Optimization:

Refactor codebase for efficiency and readability.
Implement caching for recipe searches to minimize API calls and optimize performance.
Phase 8: Launch Preparation & Beta Testing (Weeks 41-44)
Beta Testing:

Conduct a closed beta with selected users or a small group for feedback.
Collect and analyze feedback, and make final adjustments.
Deployment:

Deploy server to production environment.
Publish the app on the App Store and Google Play.
Phase 9: Post-Launch and Enhancements (Post-Launch)
User Feedback Collection:

Gather user feedback to fix any post-launch bugs and improve usability.
Regular Updates:

Add new content like challenges, improve the recommendation algorithm, or add new video tutorials.
Work on planned integrations with campus discounts and local business partnerships.
Ongoing Maintenance
Every Month: Perform app updates, bug fixes, and general maintenance based on usage data and user feedback.
