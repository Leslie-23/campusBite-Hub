# CampusBite Development Strategy

## 1. Initial Setup & Foundation (Weeks 1-6)

### Technical Stack Selection

- **Frontend**: React Native (for cross-platform support)
  - UI Framework: React Native Paper or Native Base (Still considering React Only)
  - State Management: Redux Toolkit (simpler than plain Redux)
  - Navigation: React Navigation 6
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express
  - Authentication: Firebase Auth (easier to implement than Auth0)
  - Database: MongoDB (flexible schema for social features)
  - API: REST with Express
- **Cloud Services**:
  - Firebase (Auth + Storage)
  - MongoDB Atlas (Database)
  - Heroku (Backend Hosting)

### Development Environment Setup

1. Set up development tools:

   - VS Code with React Native extensions
   - MongoDB Compass for database management
   - Postman for API testing
   - Git for version control

2. Create project structure:

```
campusbite/
├── client/           # React app -- with a possible PWA (through a manifest.js)
├── server/           # Node.js backend
└── shared/           # Shared types/utilities
```

## 2. Phased Development Approach

### Phase A: Core Features (Weeks 7-16)

Focus on building a working MVP with essential features:

1. **Authentication System**

   - Email/password signup/login
   - Basic profile management
   - Session handling

2. **Recipe Management**

   - Basic Spoonacular API integration
   - Recipe search with filters
   - Recipe saving functionality

3. **Basic Meal Planning**
   - Weekly meal calendar
   - Simple grocery list generation

### Phase B: Enhanced Features (Weeks 17-28)

Build upon the core functionality:

1. **Advanced Recipe Features**

   - Ingredient-based search
   - Dietary preferences
   - Cost estimation

2. **Nutrition Tracking**

   - Basic nutrition dashboard
   - Weekly nutrition summaries
   - Goal setting

3. **Enhanced Meal Planning**
   - Drag-and-drop meal calendar
   - Smart grocery list with categories
   - Budget tracking

### Phase C: Social Features (Weeks 29-40)

Add community aspects:

1. **Social Feed**

   - User profiles
   - Photo sharing
   - Recipe sharing

2. **Community Features**
   - Comments and likes
   - Follow system
   - Basic challenges

## 3. Development Best Practices

### Code Organization

```typescript
// Example Feature Module Structure
feature/
├── components/     # React components
├── services/      # API calls
├── store/         # Redux slice
├── types/         # TypeScript types
└── utils/         # Helper functions
```

### Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**

   - Jest for business logic
   - React Native Testing Library for components

2. **Integration Tests**

   - API endpoint testing
   - User flow testing

3. **E2E Tests**
   - Detox for critical flows
   - Manual testing checklist

### Performance Optimization

1. **Frontend**

   - Implement lazy loading
   - Use memo and callbacks appropriately
   - Image optimization

2. **Backend**
   - Implement caching (Redis)
   - Pagination for lists
   - Query optimization

## 4. Deployment Strategy

### Beta Release (Week 41-44)

1. **Preparation**

   - Feature freeze
   - Bug fixing
   - Performance optimization

2. **Testing**
   - Internal testing
   - Limited user beta
   - Feedback collection

### Production Release

1. **App Store Submission**

   - iOS App Store
   - Google Play Store

2. **Backend Deployment**
   - Set up monitoring
   - Configure auto-scaling
   - Implement backup strategy

## 5. Post-Launch Plan

### Monitoring & Maintenance

- Implement error tracking (Sentry)
- Set up performance monitoring
- Create automated backups

### Feature Roadmap

1. **Short-term**

   - Bug fixes
   - Performance improvements
   - User-requested features

2. **Long-term**
   - Advanced social features
   - AI-powered recommendations
   - Campus partnerships

## 6. Development Tips

### Priority Management

1. Focus on core features first
2. Use feature flags for gradual rollout
3. Maintain a backlog for future features

### Technical Considerations

1. Keep the architecture modular
2. Use TypeScript for better maintainability
3. Implement proper error handling
4. Cache Spoonacular API responses
5. Use background jobs for heavy operations

### Risk Mitigation

1. Regular backups
2. Comprehensive error logging
3. Rate limiting on API endpoints
4. Input validation and sanitization
